This is the official github repository for the paper Fractured Glass, Failing Cameras: 

Steps:-

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### For simulation

For simulating glass patterns. Set the parameters as desired or use the default parameters.

```python
python simulation.py
```

###  For PBR
To overlay the simulated pattern on an existing image
```
python PBR.py
```
